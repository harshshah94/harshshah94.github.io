      <description>Hello World!! I recently graduated from University at Albany with masters degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about software development and design. I posses strong problem solving and analytical skills. My other areas of interests include Machine Learning, Cloud computing and Natural Language Processing. When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time in reading books, solving puzzles and brainstorming tech news updates.</description>
